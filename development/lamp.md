# Install LAMP Server on Linux Mint 19 Cinnamon

* Update Linux

  ```text
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
  ```

* Reboot

  ```text
  sudo reboot
  ```

* Install the LAMP Server

  ```text
  sudo apt-get install lamp-server^ -y
  ```

* Setup MySQL

_Just enter a password for the root account twice when you asked_

* Test Apache

  ```text
  http://localhost
  ```

* Test PHP

  ```text
  sudo nano /var/www/html/info.php
  ```

_Add the below line_

```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

_Then CTRL+X then y and Enter_

_In your browser paste this line:_

```text
http://localhost/info.php
```

_Note: Different versions of Linux store files in different folders by default._ _If the PHP test throws a browser error, you probably need to investigate and find_ _out exactly where the test file is stored._

* Install PHPMyAdmin

  ```text
  sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin -y
  ```

_Note: You cannot login to phpmyadmin using root any more, So do as below to login_ _with same privileges but with another user._

* Login to mysql

  ```text
  sudo mysql -u root
  ```

_Grant privileges to a new user execute below command in mysql interface: “replace new-user with the name you need”_

```sql
CREATE USER 'new-user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'new-user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

* Now exit mysql and restart mysql

  ```text
  exit
  service mysql restart
  ```

* Create a link in /var/www like this:

```
sudo ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin /var/www/
```

> Note: since 14.04 you may want to use /var/www/html/ instead of /var/www/

If that's not working for you, you need to include PHPMyAdmin inside apache configuration.

* Open apache.conf using your favorite editor, mine is vim :)

```
sudo vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

* Then add the following line:

```
Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
```

* Test in broswer:

  ```text
  http://localhost/phpmyadmin
  ```
