# Design Patterns

- Design patterns are optimized reuseable solutions to the programming problems that we encounter every day.
- A design pattern is a description, or template, for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
- A good design pattern should be implementable in most if not all languages, depending on the capabilities of the language.

There are three basic kinds of design patterns:

1. Creational (Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Object Pool, Prototype, Singleton)
2. Structural (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy)
3. Behavioral (Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor)

Generally, the three groups above define how your program elements relate to each other, how they get created and how they communicate with each other.

## Singleton

Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one instance of a class is created.


Singleton may be used when:

- You need access to a shared resouce.
- Access to a shared resource will be requested for multiple seperate parts of your program.
- Only one object can be instantiated.
